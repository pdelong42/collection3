I've airlifted this from the collectd project using git-filter-branch.  It's a
basic no-frills web interface to browsing graphs rendered on-the-fly by
collectd.  I plucked it from the contrib folder of the collectd project, with
history intact for only those commits that apply to this sub-tree.  My thanks
to this guy for very lucid and to-the-point instructions on how to do this:

My hope is to correct some perceived (by me) bugs, and maybe contribute them
back to the original author.  I take no credit for the original code up to this
point.
